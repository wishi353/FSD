        <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent       , and are all related to a single topic.
        Almost every piece of writing you do 
        
        
        that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.</p>

        <h3> What does Parser do? </h3>
        <p> No matter how much whitespaces you use inside html element content (which can include one or more space characters, but also line breaks),
            the html parser reduces each sequence of whitespaces to a single space when rendering the code.
